# EPQ Calculator

This is a calculator I made for my Extended Project Qualification (2020/21). A google drive folder containing my **full** submission can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17eVtX6k3sckr00V5xlsmQyD4ZomX0GNU?usp=drive_link "See my submission in full!")<a href="placeholder.com" target="_blank">Opens in new tab</a>, and you can have a play with it yourself on the web [here]!

## I Background

This involved over 120 hours of independent research to design a calculator interface in Unity that was both functional and easy to use. I met regularly with my supervisor and maintained a production log throughout to keep my progress on track. After I was happy with my calculator following an iterative design process, I uploaded it online using WebGL so I could easy share it for testing and feedback which I could use to further improve my design. At the end of the project, I had to produce a 5000 word report and present my project to a board of examiners, clearly explaining what I had achieved and learned.

I used C# and the Unity 3D game engine (version 2019.4.1f1) to program and design the calculator. For version control I used SourceTree. My IDE for the project was Visual Studio.
